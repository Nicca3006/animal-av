== Starting and Playing ANIMAL Animations

ANIMAL’s animation player is included in ANIMAL and is also useful for checking the animation currently under development. +
To start the player, simply type the following command:

 java animal.main.Animal

If this leads to the following message

`Can´t find class animal.main.Animal`

you must update your CLASSPATH environment variable first to include the ANIMAL archive file `Animal.jar`.
This is usually done by locating the place where CLASSPATH is set and appending an entry like

`C:\Java\Animal.jar`

for `Windows` users, or

`$HOME/Java/Animal.jar`

for users of UNIX-based operating systems.
If you are unfamiliar with how to do this, take a look at the Java documentation which should including information about setting the CLASSPATH. +
To start the ANIMAL animation player, choose the entry `Show Animation` in the `Edit` menu of ANIMAL’s main window shown in <<F3,figure 3>>.
See <<F4,figure 4>> for a screen shot of this operation. +
The player itself consists of a single window with video player-like functionality, magnification setting and step choice.
<<F1, Figure 1>> shows an example window. +
Most of the player is taken up by the _animation canvas_ in which the actual animation is shown. +
Below this are the controls for the current animation.
These consist of a series of buttons which are used to

* jump to the animation’s first step |<;
* go to the previous step _without_ playing out the animators contained in the step <<;
* _pause_ before changing the to the next step ||; +
Note that this is only useful if there is a _timed link_ between the current step and the next step.
* _play_ the current step, ie. activate all animators >;
* go to the next step _without_ playing out the animators contained in the >>;
* jump to the animation’s last step >|.

The next component is a _slider_ showing how far the animation has progressed.
By clicking on the slider icon and dragging the mouse, a “skip forward” effect can be obtained, resulting in a execution of the steps dragged over.
The slider can thus also be used to jump to a different step (whether backward or forward) in the animation.

Note that this may cause problems while generating animations, as the numbers of the animation steps need not be _always_ sequential.
If you encounter such problems, simply save your animation and reload it, and the problem should be solved. +
The next component allows the user to select a _magnification_ for the display.
This is especially helpful for very broad or high animations, grabbing screen shots or scaling the components to allow a switch from computer presentation to beamer presentation in lectures. +
Due to scaling anomalities, only the following “sane” scaling factors are supported:

* 50%,
* 71%,
* 100% (default),
* 141%,
* 200%
