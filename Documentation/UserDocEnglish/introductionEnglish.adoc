== Introduction
ANIMAL is a compact, efficient and easy to use animation tool developed at the University of Siegen starting in 1998.
The motivation for developing ANIMAL came from a lack of satisfying tools for animations that are both easy to generate and edit and helpful in lectures. +
ANIMAL is an acronym for A NEW INTERACTIVE MODELLER FOR ANIMATIONS IN LECTURES, which already shows the main area of usage for ANIMAL. +
ANIMAL’s strengths lie mainly in the following areas:

* very easy to use graphic interface incorporating _drag and drop_,
* animations can be automatically generated using either the scripting language ANIMALSCRIPT or the ANIMALGENERATOR API,
* platform neutral implementation in `Java`,
* high flexibility.

On first using ANIMAL, the program might appear somewhat limited in the animation effects as well as the primitive graphic types offered.
Other programs seem to offer a far more operations at first glance. +
However, a closer look will quick reveal that this impression is not necessarily accurate.
Some other programs tend to offer the same basic effect not as a configurable effect, but rather as a collection of effects.
ANIMAL offers highly flexible, adaptable effects that can usually perform the same other animation programs also offer - although the list of “supported effects” at first seems much shorter.
Check out section <<Generating A New Animation>> for an in-depth description of the basic effects available and what operations can be done by using them wisely. +
Finally, the high flexibility mentioned above comes from the simple fact that practically all operations and objects ANIMAL uses are easy to edit and adapt to specific needs.
Furthermore, the available object or animation effect types are not coded directly into the implementation.
Thus, developers should find it very easy to add extensions to ANIMAL without having to touch much existing code. +
Using the new additions to ANIMAL, it is very easy to generate interesting animations to enhance viewers’ motivation and understanding of the topics presented. +
ANIMAL is freely available on the _World Wide Web_, complete with a extensive collection of animations including screen shots and description.
