== 1 Introduction
ANIMAL is a compact, efficient and easy to use animation tool developed at the University of Siegen starting in 1998.
The motivation for developing ANIMAL came from a lack of satisfying tools for animations that are both easy to generate and edit and helpful in lectures. +
ANIMAL is an acronym for A NEW INTERACTIVE MODELLER FOR ANIMATIONS IN LECTURES, which already shows the main area of usage for ANIMAL. +
ANIMAL’s strengths lie mainly in the following areas:

* very easy to use graphic interface incorporating drag and drop,
* animations can be automatically generated using either the scripting language ANIMALSCRIPT or the ANIMALGENERATOR API,
* platform neutral implementation in Java,
* high flexibility.

On first using ANIMAL , the program might appear somewhat limited in the animation effects as well as the primitive graphic types offered.
Other programs seem to offer a far more operations at first glance. +
However, a closer look will quick reveal that this impression is not necessarily accurate.
Some other programs tend to offer the same basic effect not as a configurable effect, but rather as a collection of effects.
ANIMAL offers highly flexible, adaptable effects that can usually perform the same other animation programs also offer - although the list of “supported effects” at first seems much shorter.
Check out section <<4 Generating A New Animation>> for an in-depth description of the basic effects available and what operations can be done by using them wisely. +
Finally, the high flexibility mentioned above comes from the simple fact that practically all operations and objects ANIMAL uses are easy to edit and adapt to specific needs.
Furthermore, the available object or animation effect types are not coded directly into the implementation.
Thus, developers should find it very easy to add extensions to ANIMAL without having to touch much existing code. +
Using the new additions to ANIMAL, it is very easy to generate interesting animations to enhance viewers’ motivation and understanding of the topics presented. +
ANIMAL is freely available on the World Wide Web, complete with a extensive collection of animations including screen shots and description.
Check out the official ANIMAL Home page at http://www.informatik.uni-siegen.de/˜roesslin/Animal/index.html for more information.

== 2 Requirements
ANIMAL is implemented completely in Java.
This means several things, one of which Java
being that the performance is - alas - at times somewhat slower than one might wish. +
It also means, however, that the hardware / software requirements for using ANIMAL are very easy to specify: your computer must be able to run Java.
This is something that practically all current computer models can do, although with a wide difference in performance.
We recommend a moderately modern computer with a “enough” RAM, since Java itself is somewhat memory-intensive on most platforms.
For example, ANIMAL runs smoothly on my laptop (Pentium II Mobile, 300 MHz, with 64 MB RAM). +
As stated above, ANIMAL is implemented completely in 100% Pure Java, using JDK: 1.1.5+ SUN’s JDK 1.1.5 or above.
The only further requirement is Swing , the graphic pack- Swing 1.1.1 age collection that provides a far more attractive alternative to Java’s original Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT).
ANIMAL is currently only available for the current Swing 1.1.1 release also included in JDK 1.2+. +
ANIMAL has been developed both on Digital AlphaStation running Digital OSF Tested platforms v4.0 – also known as Digital Unix – and Intel-based computers running Linux, FreeBSD, Windows 95 / 98 and Windows NT.
It has also been tested on an Apple Powerbook and thus underscores Java’s claim of “write once, run everywhere”. +
Note that changes in the class libraries, especially the renaming of the Swing pack- JDK support ages, prevents us from providing support for both JDK 1.1.5+ and JDK 1.2 / 2.0 with the same **source** code.
The binary Java code for JDK 1.1.5+ will run under JDK 1.2, so this is the main release we support.

== 3 Starting and Playing ANIMAL Animations

ANIMAL’s animation player is included in ANIMAL and is also useful for checking the animation currently under development. +
To start the player, simply type the following command:

 java animal.main.Animal

If this leads to the following message

 Can’t find class animal.main.Animal

you must update your CLASSPATH environment variable first to include the ANIMAL archive file Animal.jar.
This is usually done by locating the place where CLASSPATH is set and appending an entry like

 C:\Java\Animal.jar

for Windows users, or

 $HOME/Java/Animal.jar

for users of UNIX-based operating systems.
If you are unfamiliar with how to do this, take a look at the Java documentation which should including information about setting the CLASSPATH. +
To start the ANIMAL animation player, choose the entry Show Animation in the Edit menu of ANIMAL’s main window shown in figures 3.
See figure 4 for a screen shot of this operation. +
The player itself consists of a single window with video player-like functionality, magnification setting and step choice.
Figure 1 shows an example window. +
Most of the player is taken up by the _animation canvas_ in which the actual animation is shown. +
Below this are the controls for the current animation.
These consist of a series of buttons which are used to

* jump to the animation’s first step <|;
* go to the previous step _without_ playing out the animators contained in the step <<;
* _pause_ before changing the to the next step ||; +
Note that this is only useful if there is a _timed link_ between the current step and the next step.
* _play_ the current step, ie. activate all animators >;
* go to the next step _without_ playing out the animators contained in the step ensuremath¿¿;
* jump to the animation’s last step >|.

The next component is a _slider_ showing how far the animation has progressed.
By clicking on the slider icon and dragging the mouse, a “skip forward” effect can be obtained, resulting in a execution of the steps dragged over.
The slider can thus also be used to jump to a different step (whether backward or forward) in the animation.

image::Figure 1 ANIMAL Player front end.jpg[]
[.text-center]
Figure 1: ANIMAL Player front end

Note that this may cause problems while generating animations, as the numbers of the animation steps need not be _always_ sequential.
If you encounter such problems, simply save your animation and reload it, and the problem should be solved. +
The next component allows the user to select a _magnification_ for the display.
This is especially helpful for very broad or high animations, grabbing screen shots or scaling the components to allow a switch from computer presentation to beamer presentation in lectures. +
Due to scaling anomalities, only the following “sane” scaling factors are supported:

* 50%,
* 71%,
* 100% (default),
* 141%,
* 200%

== 4 Generating A New Animation

In this example, you will use a few simple steps to generate a short but interesting animation about the behavior of the data structure _singly-linked list_.
This animation will illustrate how to use ANIMAL to easily visually build animations. +
The final result of this process will look roughly as follows:

image::Figure 2 Final result of the tutorial animation.jpg[align="center"]
[.text-center]
Figure 2: Final result of the tutorial animation

Don’t worry, reaching this result is really not difficult. But now, let’s get going!

=== 4.1 Preparation for the new Animation

First of all, you must start ANIMAL as described in <<3 Starting and Playing ANIMAL Animations, chapter 3>>.
After a while spent on initialization and loading the initial animation, (at least) ANIMAL’s main window is shown:

image::Figure 3 ANIMALs Main Window.jpg[]
[.text-center]
Figure 3: ANIMALs Main Window

This window contains menus for _file operations_ (File), opening and closing the windows (Edit) used for editing and viewing the animation, setting the _Options_ (menu Options), and Help.
Furthermore, it has a list of buttons which serve as a shortcut for – from left to right – _New Animation, Load Animation, Input_ ANIMALSCRIPT, _Save Animation, Save Animation As..._ +

For now, you need to create _new animation_, so you should do _either_ of the following two operations:

* Click on the first button in ANIMAL’s main window showing a _blank sheet_,
* or click on the menu File and select its first entry, New. +
You can also use shortcuts by pressing the shortcut key and the letter highlighted in the menu - in this case, F, so press both ALT and F, and the menu will be displayed.
If not, you probably have to replace ALT by CTRL.
If this does not work either, ask your system administrator for the local configuration details. +
After the menu is shown, pressing N – the letter shown after the entry New – is the same as clicking on New.

=== 4.2 ANIMAL’s Draw Window

First of all, you are going to draw a simple object: the _rectangle_ underlining the title.
To do so, you have to open ANIMAL’s _Draw Window_.
Go to the Edit menu and select the entry Show Draw Window, if the window is not already opened.
The menu should now have a check mark in from of the entry Draw Window as shown in figure 4 on the following page. +
ANIMAL’s drawing window looks as shown in figure 5 on page 10.
At the top of DrawWindow the window, you can see a row of _buttons_ for _object generation_ - the _Object Toolbar_.
Below this row on the window’s left are some helpful buttons, the _animation step selection_ and a _options_ entry.
The _status line_ at the bottom of the window always displays information about the semantics of the currently selected operation. +
Tables 1 on page 11 and 2 on page 12 summarize the buttons shown. +
The main part of the window is taken up by the _drawing area_ – here showing a snapshot of the _Quicksort_ animation.
This is the place where all objects are drawn.

=== 4.3 Activating Grid Support

First, you should activate a _grid_ for easier and more precise drawing.
Referring to figure 5 on page 10, click on the _pop-down menu_ labeled Grid and set the value to 20.
Then look for the following button directly below and to the left of the Grid menu:

image::Figure 4 Selecting the displayed windows.jpg[]
[.text-center]
Figure 4: Selecting the displayed windows.
Here, both Animation and Draw Window are opened.

////
:imagesdir: src/graphics/

image::append.gif[]
////
If the button has a dark grey background, the _Grid Snap_ is already turned on; otherwise, click once on the button.
This button serves as a _toggle_ - each click _inverts_ the selection and thus changes from _grid off_ to _grid on_ and vice versa.
The _grid_ is helpful for precise drawing, as it adds a line every _n_ pixels in both horizontal and vertical orientation.
The exact value of _n_ depends on your selection; in this case, the distance between two lines is _n=20 pixels_.
By activating _Grid Snap_, you can only draw points falling exactly on those points where two such grid lines meet, and not “in between”.

=== 4.4 Drawing the Header Rectangle

As the first thing you should draw is the _title highlight rectangle_, click on the symbol for _polyline / polygon_ showing a short line: image:Button_newPolylineOrOlygonObject.JPG[] +
This will cause a window labeled Polyline Options to pop up showing one of the displays given in figure 6 on page 13.
Move this window out of your way, _but do not close it_. +
Now, set the _first_ rectangle point by clicking on the first point where two of the grid Polyline drawing lines meet – the coordinate (20, 20).
Now move the mouse to the right over the next *11* vertical lines (to coordinate (260, 20)).
You should see a line being drawn between the first set point and the current mouse position. +
Click the left mouse button again to set the second point.
Now go down two horizontal lines to coordinate (260, 60) and again click the _left_ mouse button.
Finally, go left until you are at the point directly below the first point and click the middle to finish the component.
It should now look like a U turned by 90 degrees, open to the left.
The component is now finished...but it is not really a rectangle, as it is still open!

=== 4.5 Setting Object Attributes and Color

Go to the Polyline Options window shown in figure 6 on page 13 and click on the entry _Attributes_ to bring up _Object Attribute Selection Pane_. +
Here, you can set some options for the component.
As you need a _filled rectangle_, click once box before the entry closed to add a line connecting the first and last node.
After clicking on the box, a check mark appears before the entry.
Now you have a closed rectangle, but still not a filled one.
So, simply click on the entry filled which is only active if closed is also selected.
Now the rectangle is filled. +
If the colors are not to your liking, click on the _Color_ label in the _Polyline Options_ window and select a new color for the _rectangle outline_ with the _Polyline_: menu, or a new fill color using the _Fillcolor_: menu.
The menu is used just as the _Grid_ menu - just click on it to open the menu and select an entry by clicking on it.
If the entry you look for is not visible, use the _scrollbars_ on the right as shown in figure 7 on page 14. +
To make sure that the header is placed on the rectangle, and not the other way round, you can set the _depth_ of the polygon to a value larger than the one for the text.
For now, set the depth to 16 , as shown in the screen shot.
The higher this value is, the further to the background (”deeper”) the object will be, and will thus be more like to be partially hidden by other objects. +
When you’re done, press the _OK_ button in the _Polyline Editor_ to close the window.
Next, press the _Write Back_ button to store the current state of the animation.
The button looks like this:

=== 4.6 Drawing A Text Component

Now you can add the header text “List element demo” to your current animation.
To do so, first click on the symbol for text showing the capital letter A:
//TODO: insert image
This will open the _editor window_ for text components with title Text Options, similar to what happened when you clicked on the _polyline / polygon_ symbol.
This editor window is shown in figure 8 on page 15.
The _depth_ part of the window is not shown, as this is identical for all objects. +
First, we are going to set the _text font_. Therefore, click on the _Font_ tab, and set the values as shown in figure 8 on page 15 to _SansSerif_ font, size _24_, neither _italics_ nor _bold_. +
For entering the text, click once on the _Text_ tab for entering the text itself.

image::Figure 7 Color Selection Menu.jpg[align="center"]
[.text-center]
Figure 7: Color Selection Menu

Now simply type in the text “List element demo” into the _text field_ as shown in figure 8 on the following page.
You can also adjust the text color as described in section 4.5 on page 11.
Place the text inside the _header rectangle_ by clicking on the first point at the bottom _inside_ the rectangle.
Your text should now have 20 pixels space to both the left and right side, and touch the bottom line of the header rectangle as follows:

image::Image_ListElementDemo.jpg[align="center"]
You can also experiment with the _Font_ settings after the text has been placed - just
change back to the _Font_ tab and see what happens when you click on the _italics_ or _bold_ check boxes footnote:[Note that some systems may not support SansSerif fonts which are italics, bold or bold italics. This
is not a problem caused within ANIMAL’s ability to handle, but reflects the Java installation settings.].
Before continuing, make sure you have set the entries back to _SansSerif_ size 24 with neither _italics_ nor _bold_. +
When you’re done, press the _OK_ button in the _Text Editor_ to close the window.

=== 4.7 Adjusting Object Placement

The current display is not very attractive, as the header text has some free space to the left, but none to the right.
To change this, you have to _turn off Grid Snap_, since moving the text to the left would only invert the situation: no space to the left, but free space to the right.
Therefore, click once on the _Grid Snap_ icon image:Button_SnapModeOnOff.JPG[] as described in section <<4.3 Activating Grid Support,4.3>> to turn it off for now.

image::Figure 8 Text Editor Window for setting text options.jpg[align="center"]
[.text-center]
Figure 8: Text Editor Window for setting text options

Now, you can click on the text – _anywhere_ inside the text.
An outline around the text with circles at all edges (two circles at the bottom left) should appear, looking like this:

image::Image_ListElementDemoCircles.JPG[align="center"]
Now, click on one of the circles and _keep the left mouse button pressed_.
These circles are called *drag points* and are used for dragging the object along with any mouse movements.
So, move your mouse around a bit and see how the text follows the movement. +
When you try to center the text in this _freehand style_ inside the header rectangle, you may find it difficult to place it precisely in the middle.
To make this somewhat easier, drop the text somewhere by releasing the left mouse button.
Now, turn _Grid Snap_ back on as described above.
Then, set the Grid width to *5* as described in section <<4.3 Activating Grid Support,4.3>> on page 8 and repeat the moving process by clicking on the text and dragging it using one of the _drag points_.
You should find it easy to (roughly) center the text now.

=== 4.8 Generating A New Animation Step

The current display containing the centered heading shall be enough for the animation start.
Therefore, we need to add a _new animation step_ for the next display.
To do so, open the _Animation OverviewWindow_ by activating the entry Show Animation Overview in the Edit menu of ANIMAL’s main window as shown in figure 3 on page 8.
The window which opens should look as shown in figure 4.8.

image::Image_AnimationOverview.jpg[align="center"]

At the top and bottom of this window, there is set of buttons.
The top button row is used for _adding animation effects_, while the bottom button row offers operations for _animation maintenance_. +
The top button row from left to right contains buttons for the following animation effects:

* show / hide without timing – deprecated, only available for backwards compatibility; image:show_.png[]
* moving selected objects,
* rotating selected objects,
* changing the color of selected objects,
* and showing / hiding selected objects with adjustable timing.
The bottom button row contains the following buttons from left to right:
* Prepend new step
This is used to insert a new animation step before the current animation step.
Especially useful when you find you need a new step inserted before the current
first animation step.
 Append new step Append Step
This adds a new animation step directly after the current animation step.
 Redraw Redraw Display
This button causes a redraw of the window and is useful when the display becomes
muddied.
 Delete Delete Step/Object
This button is used to delete the currently selected entry - either an animation
effect or an animation step.
In the situation shown in 4.8 on the preceding page, selecting the button – don’t
do this now – would delete the current animation step. Of course, a dialog will
ask for confirmation before such an operation is actually carried out.
As we want to add a new animation step after the current first animation step,
click once on the Append Step button . This will lead to the addition of the new
animation step 2 and will also directly set this as the current animation step.
4.9 Entering Several Lines Of Text
Now, we are going to enter the documentation for this animation. This consists of the
following text entries:
 1. Generate first list element
 2. Set link of first list element to null
 3. Generate new list element
 4. Clear link of second list element
17
 5. Link first with second list element
 6. Generate new list element
 7. Link new with second list element
 8. Link first with new element
 9. Transform into ’nice’ list structure
First, set the grid size back to 20 and turn on Grid Snap if it is not already turned
on.
Now open the Text Editor again as described in section 4.6 on page 13. Select Entering Text
either SansSerif or Monospaced as the font, size 16, neither italics nor bold.
Enter the first text – 1. Generate first list element – as before by
typing it into the text field under the Text tab. If you do not recall how this is done, look
it up in section 4.6 on page 13.
Place the text at at the same horizontal position as the header rectangle, but 8 lines Entering multiple
below it. Do not close the Text Editor window!
Now, enter the second text, replacing the first text in the text field. Do not press
OK or Apply! Position the new text one line below the first text. Proceed in the same
way with the other lines of text until you reach the state shown in figure 9 on the next
page.
If you have made some typing mistake, you can fix it either Correct Typos
 before you have placed another object: simply adapt the text in the text field and
press the Apply button,
 after you placed another object: close the Editor window after placing the current
object, then click on the object in question. If the Text Editor does not open, you
have to click on the Editor button on the left border of the Draw Window:
4.10 Storing An Animation
This is a good time for storing the animation! Animations are stored in one of the
following ways: Storing
 Clicking on the Save button in ANIMAL’s main window ,
 Clicking on the SaveAs button in ANIMAL’s main window ,
 Selecting Save from the File menu in ANIMAL’s main window,
 or selecting Save As from the File menu in ANIMAL’s main window.
18
Figure 9: State after entering the animation documentation
19
These components are shown in figure 3 on page 8.
As you have not yet selected a filename for this animation, you will be prompted for
a filename regardless of whether you chose Save or SaveAs. The dialog for filename
selection looks as shown in figure 10.
Figure 10: ANIMAL’s File Selector. The possible file format selections are shown at
the bottom.
Normally, you will want to store the file in compressed ASCII format. Note that Preferred Format
this is the first entry in the list and is clearly marked as preferred.
4.11 Generating A List Element
Before you generate the first list element, please insert a new step by pressing the append
button in ANIMAL’s Animation Overview window as described in section 4.8 on
page 16. This should be step 3. Note how this addition of a new step also automatically
causes ANIMAL to update its AnimationOverview window by adding an entry for
displaying the text components entered so far.
For generating a new list element, select the List Element button - also called a List Elements
BoxPointer due to its look. The button looks as follows:
The list element needed has the text entry Elem 1 and one pointer. Therefore, Set Text, Pointer
select the Text tab to enter the text Elem 1 without pressing OK or Apply, then
change to the Pointer tab to choose the following settings: position bottom, 1 pointer.
After you have done so, place the list element. The first click places the basic object Placing List Elements
and should place it two 20-pixel squares to the left of the header rectangle box, with 20
pixels space between the element and the rectangle.
20
The second click places the object’s pointer, which should point to the next possible Placing List Pointers
point to the lower right of the object. Note how the status line at the bottom of the
DrawWindow tells you exactly what each mouse click means. Your display should
now resemble figure 11.
Figure 11: State of the animation after adding the first element
4.12 Highlighting Elements By Color Changing
In order to make sure users understand the connection between the new list element
and the first instruction, you can change this line to red. However, if you do so using
the Text Editor, you actually change the color of the object for the whole animation,
which is unwanted in this case.
Therefore, choose the ColorChanger button in ANIMAL’s AnimationOverview Color Changer
window instead. This brings up the ColorChanger Editor title ColorChanger Options,
shown in figure 12 on the following page.
First, click on the Select Objects button at the top of the Color Changer Editor. The
button will now turn dark to show it is active.
Go to the DrawWindow and click once on the first text line. Notice how the entry in
the Color Changer Editor changes. The editor allows you to select as many objects for
21
Figure 12: ColorChanger Editor window
simultaneous animation as you want; for now, the text line is sufficient, though. Click
again on the Select Objects button, which should now no longer be dark, but display a
message like Selected Objects: 3.
Next, choose the animation method from the list. For a text component, this is Method Selection
limited to the default entry color, so you do not really have to do anything here.
Finally, you can decide whether you want to use a delay before the object changes Delay
color. The duration is ineffectual for color changes. Note that you can decide between
ticks or ms (milliseconds). For ms, multiples of 100 make sense. For ticks, you can
use smaller units, such as 5 or ten.
Set the delay to a short interval, for example 10 ticks. Finally, choose the target
color, for example red.
Now open the Animation Window by selecting the Show Animation entry in the Testing
Edit menu of ANIMAL’s main window (see section 4.2 on page 8 if you are unsure
of how to do this). Watch your animation and see what happens in step 3.
Strange... first the element is shown, then the line is highlighted! Change this by
double clicking on the line containing the ColorChanger in the Animation Overview
window as shown in figure 13 on the following page.
The Color Changer Editor window should now be open again and allow you to set
the delay back to 0 and closing the window by pressing OK. Next, double-click on the
Show animator in the same step2. You can now assign a delay time to the display of the
list element, for example 10 ticks. Also close this window using OK.
Next, press the Run icon in the Draw Window to re-display this animation Running
2Shown below the selected ColorChanger in figure 13 on the next page

.
step. Experiment with the delay settings until you are satisfied.
Finally, insert a new step for the next effects, containing two color changes and
one move effect. These operations cannot be performed in the same step as the object
generation, as ANIMAL only allows you to use one animation effect on each object
per step. Displaying a new element causes the insertion of a show animation effect,
therefore trying to add a new effect on this element would mean having two effects for
this element.
In the new step, highlight the second command in red using the same steps as
described in the last section for generating a Color Change effect. You should now
have two red texts, which is somewhat unfortunate.
Therefore, you might want to mark the first line of text as “done”. To do so, repeat
the steps of the last section to enter a new Color Change animation effect that sets the
color of the first line to blue.
4.13 Moving Elements
The next operation calls for changing the tip (arrow) of the current list element to Move Editor
be set to null. Without changing the step, click on the Move Editor button
in ANIMAL’s Animation Overview. The window that pops up looks very similar to
23
figure 12 on page 22, but replaces the color selection with a second object selection.
Press the topmost Select Objects: button and then click on the list element in
the Draw Window. The button should now read as Selected Objects: 12 or
similar.
Next, choose a method in the Method: menu. The appropriate method for setting setTip method
the pointer of a list element is called setTip, so choose this one.
Now, also click on an arbitrary text line in the Draw Window. Notice how the
editor changes to reflect that two objects are now selected. The method is automatically
changed to translate, as this is the only Move method common to both Text and
List Element.3
Click again on the text line to deselect it. If nothing happens, click on the Select
Objects: button again to reactivate it (it must have a dark background) and again click
on the selected text. Finally, change the method back to setTip.
Now you will have to draw a line along which the tip is to be moved. To do so, set Move Line
the Grid back to 5. Select the polyline icon and draw a simple line as follows:
 the line’s first point is identical to the top of the arrow,
 the line’s second and last point – set by pressing the middle mouse button! –
should roughly be one the same height as the starting point of the tip and lie
inside the element box.
An example of this line looks as follows:
Next, select this line as the Move via object using the bottom Select Objects: button.
You can also set a delay and duration as described in section 4.12 on page 21.
The final look of the Move Editor window before clicking on OK should resemble
figure 4.13 on the following page, although your timing and object numbers may differ.
Again, use the Run icon to test your animation as described on on page 22 until you
are satisfied with your results.
The next step is simply a repetition of previous work in which you have to do the
following operations:
1. generate a new step,
2. change the color of the second text line to blue,
3. change the color of the third text line to red,
4. generate a new list element with text Elem 2, placed on the same height as the
first element, but a fair distance to the right so that its left line coincides with the
left line of header rectangle.
3ANIMAL automatically adapts the list to those methods common to all selected methods. If there is no
such method, the method bar will read No appropriate method!

The result of these operations should resemble figure 14 on the following page.
Insert another new step containing the following steps:
1. change color of third text line to blue,
2. change color of fourth text line to red,
3. add a move animator as described above.
This time, however, draw the move line somewhere else at any place, such that
the second (=last) point is 10 pixels to the left and 10 pixels above the first point.
Select this line as the Move via object and test your animation. You will see
that ANIMAL uses relative movement – the line only shows how to change the
object’s position, and does not need to start at the targeted object.
The result of these operations should resemble figure 15 on page 27. The small
arrow in the display is the move line. The display of this line can be toggled using the
Show Temporary Objects button in the Draw Window. Show Temporary
Now generate a new step with the following operations:
1. change color of fourth text line to blue,
2. change color of fifth text line to red,
3. insert a Move animator for linking the two elements.
To do so, generate a new Move animation effect, select the first list element and
choose the method setTip.

Then click on the bottommost Selected Objects: button and draw a new polyline
going from the first list element’s tip position to the left border of the second list
element. Choose appropriate timing, and test this step.
If your line is not quite the way you wanted it, do not delete and redraw it!
Simply click on the line, and apart from the drag points in circle form you will
notice small squares at both line edges4. Click on such a point and move the
mouse with the left button pressed, and you can adapt the point to your liking.
The result of these operations should resemble figure 16. The polyline arrow in the
display is the move line and was moved out of the way for better comparability.

The next few steps call for a repetition of the same steps. Place the third list element
with text Elem 3 between the two list elements, but below them.
Repeat these steps until you reach the following rough step:
4.14 Using Arc Elements
For linking the first and third list element, we will now use a arc component.
Begin with the usual operations, that is, adding a new step, changing the color of
text lines six and seven and generating a new Move animator in which you select the
first list element and the method setTip. Then, select the Move via: button “Select
Objects:”.
Click on the arc icon . Select a point directly next to the top right corner of Arc
the new list element as the arc center and click once.
Now move the mouse to see the outline of the current arc. Try to manage that Arc Generation
this arc line touches both the tip of the first list element and the left side of the new
list element at the same height as that element’s tip. Figure 18 on page 30 shows an
example of the result. This may take some time in trying out possible arc centers.
However, using the figure, you can determine where to place the element to make it
work.
Next, click on the first element’s tip end resting next to the second list element to
mark the arc start angle. The next mouse click then goes to the left side of the new list
element, and should result in something resembling figure 18 on page 30.
4These square are always available on all edges, of which this line only has two.

Test and optimize this animation step as usual.
The next few steps are a simple of the last few actions: setting the link from the
new element to the second list element and adapting the colors.
4.15 Diverse Options for Moving List Elements
For the last step, we want to reach a “nice” list structure in which all elements are at
the same height.
To do so, you could use the translate method of the Move animation effect. However,
this would also move the new element’s tip!
To avoid this problem, proceed as follows:
1. generate a new step,
2. perform the usual color highlighting on the lines 8 and 9,
3. insert a new Move animation effect on the new element, but select the method translateWithtranslateWithFixedTip.
Draw a simple polyline starting at the top of the FixedTip
new list element and going straight up to the same height as the top of the other
list elements.
4. insert a new Move animation effect on the first element, selecting the setTip
method and using the same polyline as in the previous animation effect. Yes,
you can reuse move lines – ANIMAL only forbids you to use more than a single
visible animation on the same object. Moving along a line does not change the
move line, though, so this reuse is possible.
And now

you’ve finished the tutorial!
If any lines show are not as straight as you want them, turn off the Grid and edit
the lines and corresponding move lines until you are satisfied with the result.
