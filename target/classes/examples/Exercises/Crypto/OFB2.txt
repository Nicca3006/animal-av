A block cipher is a ciphering mode to map blocks of a constant length 
to blocks of the same length. Modes of operation enable the repeated
and secure use of block ciphers under a single key. One of those modes
of operation is the Output Feedback Mode aka OFB Mode. The OFB turns
block ciphers into a synchronous stream Cipher by generating keystream
blocks which are then XORed with the plaintext blocks to get the
ciphertext blocks."

OFB Mode is pretty useful to encode long texts because same blocks
will be mapped on different blocks. So same blocks will never be encoded
as the block before.
