We want to find cubic polynomials to interpolate a given function between a few known knots.

Let S(x) be the cubic spline. We call the second derivative at x_j S’’(x_j) the “moment” M_j
[br]
S’’(x) = M_(j-1)*((x_j-x)/h_j) + M_j*((x-x_(j-1))/h_j)
[br]
S’(x) = -M_(j-1)*((x_j-x)^2/2h_j) + M_j*((x-x_(j-1)^2)/2h_j) + A
[br]
S(x) = M_(j-1)*((x_j-x)^3/6h_j) + M_j*((x-x_(j-1)^3)/6h_j) + Ax + B
