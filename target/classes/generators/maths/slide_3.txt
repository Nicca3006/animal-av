In this Animation we learned how to interpolate functions with third order polynomials
[br]
and how we can lower the error by choosing the knot points close to each other 
[br]
and using smart boundary conditions.

You should note, that the knots don’t need to be equidistant. The error grows with the 
[br]
distance between the knots so they shouldn’t be to far away from each other.
[br]
However, if you choose to many knots close to each other the computation will take longer.
[br]
We need to compromise between precision and performance.
