To be able to find the value of the variables and b that emerge from the integrations we need
[br]
to use “boundary conditions” that use information we can assume about the spline function in the knots. 
[br]
We can choose between different boundary conditions which yield different error margins.

The most common boundary conditions use the following information about the spline:
[br]
1) First derivatives at the endpoints are known
[br]
2) Second derivatives at the endpoints are known
