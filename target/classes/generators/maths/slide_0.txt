The idea behind cubic spline interpolation is to increase the accuracy of linear splines by integrating 
[br]
them twice and choosing the resulting integration constans in a smart way in order to fit 
[br]
the resulting cubic function to the original function.

In the following slides we will animate this process and show the math behind it.
