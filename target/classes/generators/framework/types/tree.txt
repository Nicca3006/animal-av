From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

In computer science, a tree is a widely-used computer data structure that emulates a tree structure with a set of linked nodes. Each node has zero or more child nodes, which are below it in the tree (in computer science, unlike in nature, trees grow down, not up). A node that has a child is called the child's parent node. A child has at most one parent; a node without a parent is called the root node (or root). Nodes with no children are called leaf nodes.

In graph theory, a tree is a connected acyclic graph. A rooted tree is such a graph with a vertex singled out as the root. In this case, any two vertices connected by an edge inherit a parent-child relationship. An acyclic graph with multiple connected components or a set of rooted trees is sometimes called a forest.

There are two basic types of tree. In an unordered tree, there is no distinction between the various children of a node --- none is the "first child" or "last child". A tree in which such distinctions are made is called an ordered tree, and data structures built on them are called ordered tree data structures. Ordered trees are by far the most common form of tree data structure.
