## General ##
title=Dragon curve

desc=The dragon curve is a fractal, which is generated similar to the Koch curve by so-called substitution.\nThis process copies and slightly changes a sequence of left and right curves.\nThe algorithm is implemented recursively and builds on the smallest dragon curve - a line, which represents a right curve.\n\n The generator can generate a dragon curve up to order 12.

## Explanation ##
expl_1=The Dragon curve is a fractal, which is generated similar to the Koch curve by so-called substitution.
expl_2=This process copies and slightly changes a sequence of left and right curves.
expl_3=The algorithm is implemented recursively and builds on the smallest dragon curve - a line, which represents a right curve.
expl_4=The animation leads through the creation of this sequence of left and right curves. An R is an abbreviation of a right curve and an L of a left curve.
expl_5=Meanwhile the returned Dragon curve is displayed step by step.

## Summary ##
summ_1=The dragon curve started with a simple vertical line and was then calculated using the
summ_2=Strings {0} is gradually evolving.
summ_3=The lower picture shows how the kite curve developed after each recursion step. 
summ_4=Until finally the picture of order {0} was obtained.
