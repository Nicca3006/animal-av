The event timestamps generated by the vector clock algorithm made it possible to determine the partial and causal order of the events.[br]
To see the partial/causal order of the events used within this animation as a graph, you may go back to the Event order label.[br]
[br]
Because the algorithm uses clock vectors with information of all processes instead of single logical clocks, events in the order are guaranteed to be in a happened-before relationship,[br]
i.e. if two event timestamps fulfill the order conditions, the real point in time when one of the two events happened is before the real point in time when the other event happened.[br]
[br]
This is an improvement to Lamport timestamps where only timestamps of single logical clocks are used and where a smaller timestamp does not guarantee that an event actually happened before another event.[br]
[br]
However, compared to Lamport timestamps, the vector clock algorithm has a higher communication complexity that increases with the amount of involved processes:[br]
The more processes are involved, the more the size of the clock vectors that have to be sent and whose entries have to be compared grows.[br]

By the way: The vector clock algorithm was developed by Colin Fidge and Friedemann Mattern in 1988.
